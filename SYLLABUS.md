This schedule is preliminary, but it should give you a good idea of what you can expect.

### Unit 1: Security Foundations (3–4 weeks)

This unit will include an overview of many concepts fundamental to computer security:

- Confidentiality, integrity, availability
- Threat models
- Kerckhoff's principle
- Ethical hacking and responsible disclosure
- Authentication/authorization
- Social engineering
- Attack surface
- Side/covert channels
- Secure design principles
- Using and abusing machine learning

### Unit 2: Web Security (4–5 weeks)

This unit provides the necessary background to understand how web applications work. It then covers common threats, vulnerabilities, and defenses in a web context. Accompanied by the textbook *“Web Application Security”* by Andrew Hoffman.

- Web overview (HTTP, DNS, Cookies, Javascript, DOM, Same Origin Policy)
- Role of encryption and digital signatures (HTTPS and DNSSEC)
- Client-side attacks (XSS, CSRF, etc.) and defenses
- Server-side attacks (SQL injection, RCE, etc.) and defenses
- Network attacks (SSL stripping, session hijacking, etc.) and defenses
- DNS attacks (Squatting, dropcatching, cache poisoning, etc.) and defenses

---

### Unit 3: Software Security (2–3 weeks)

This unit starts with a brief refresher on low-level programming and memory layout that you learned in the prerequisite course. It then covers threats, vulnerabilities, and defenses in the context of operating systems and system software.

- Refresher on assembly and C
- Memory corruption vulnerabilities (stack/heap overflow, format strings, etc.)
- Defenses (Stack canaries, W^X stack, ASLR)
- Types and history of malware
- Detecting malware (static and dynamic analysis)
- Speculative execution attacks (Spectre/Meltdown)

---

### Unit 4: Recent Research (1–2 weeks)

This final unit provides more exposure to cutting-edge research in computer security, including presentations given by graduate students and/or guest lecturers.
